About this resource:
This data includes simulated room impulse responses with various room configs. It is intended for use when comparing the performance of acoustic models trained with data reverberated with real and simulated impulse responses. They were used in our paper "A Study on Data Augmentation of Reverberant Speech for Robust Speech Recognition" submitted to ICASSP 2017
